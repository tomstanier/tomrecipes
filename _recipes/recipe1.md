## H﻿istory:

Bulgogi chicken is a popular Korean dish that has a long and rich cultural history. The dish is believed to have originated in the Goguryeo period (37 BC-668 AD), when it was known as maekjeok. Maekjeok was a dish of marinated beef that was grilled over an open flame. Over time, the dish evolved and eventually became known as bulgogi.

Bulgogi is a combination of two words: “bul” meaning fire, and “gogi” meaning meat. The dish is traditionally made with thinly sliced beef that is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, sugar, and other seasonings. The marinated beef is then grilled over an open flame, giving it a unique smoky flavour.
